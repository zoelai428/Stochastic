# Stochastic
Final writing for the placement of stochastic, which follows the lecture on "Elementare Stochastik" at the university of Marburg.

There are two main tasks covered here:
1. $\chi^2$-Test as independence test as well as homogenity test on the dataset `HairEyeColor`
2. Homogenity of Variances, analysis of variances (ANOVA) and Tukey-Method on the dataset `ewr` from the package `UsingR`

The codes are separated into these two parts accordingly and are commented in English, but the writing is currently in German only. An English version might be uploaded by Summer 2023.
